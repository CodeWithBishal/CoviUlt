                <br>
                Since agriculture is the backbone of the country and a part of the government announced essential
                category,
                the impact is likely to be low on both primary agricultural production and usage of agro-inputs. Several
                state governments have already allowed free movement of fruits, vegetables, milk etc. Online food
                grocery
                platforms are heavily impacted due to unclear restrictions on movements and stoppage of logistics
                vehicles.
                RBI and Finance Minister announced measures will help the industry and the employees in the short term.
                Insulating the rural food production areas in the coming weeks will hold a great answer to the macro
                impact
                of COVID-19 on Indian food sector as well as larger economy.

                <h3>Aviation & Tourism</h3>
                <br>
                The contribution of the Aviation Sector and Tourism to our GDP stands at about 2.4% and 9.2%
                respectively.
                The Tourism sector served approximately 43 million people in FY 18-19. Aviation and Tourism were the
                first
                industries that were hit significantly by the pandemic. The common consensus seems to be that COVID will
                hit
                these industries harder than 9/11 and the Financial Crisis of 2008. These two industries have been
                dealing
                with severe cash flow issues since the start of the pandemic and are staring at a potential 38 million
                lay-offs, which translates to 70 per cent of the total workforce. The impact is going to fall on both,
                White
                and Blue collar jobs. According to IATO estimates, these industries may incur losses of about 85 billion
                Rupees due to travel restrictions. The Pandemic has also brought about a wave of innovation in the
                fields of
                contactless boarding and travel technologies.

                <br>
                There has been a significant amount of changes in the telecom sector of India even before the Covid-19
                due to brief price wars between the service providers. Most essential services and sectors have
                continued to run during the pandemic thanks to the implementation of the ‘work from home’ due to
                restrictions. With over 1 billion connections as of 2019, the telecom sector contributes about 6.5 per
                cent of GDP and employs almost 4 million people. Increased broadband usage had a direct impact and
                resulted in pressure on the network. Demand has been increased by about 10%. However, the Telco’s are
                bracing for a sharp drop in adding new subscribers. As a policy recommendation, the government can aid
                the sector by relaxing the regulatory compliances and provide moratorium for spectrum dues, which can be
                used for network expansions by the companies.

                <h3>Pharmaceuticals</h3>
                <br>
                The pharmaceutical industry has been on the rise since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in
                India, the largest producer of generic drugs globally. With a market size of $55 billion during the
                beginning of 2020, it has been surging in India, exporting Hydroxychloroquine to the world, esp. to the
                US, UK, Canada, and the Middle-East.There has been a recent rise in the prices of raw materials imported
                from China due to the pandemic. Generic drugs are the most impacted due to heavy reliance on imports,
                disrupted supply-chain, and labour unavailability in the industry, caused by social distancing.
                Simultaneously, the pharmaceutical industry is struggling because of the government-imposed bans on the
                export of critical drugs, equipment, and PPE kits to ensure sufficient quantities for the country. The
                increasing demand for these drugs, coupled with hindered accessibility is making things harder. Easing
                the financial stress on the pharmaceutical companies, tax-relaxations, and addressing the labour force
                shortage could be the differentiating factors in such a desperate time.

                <h3>Oil and Gas</h3>
                <br>
                The Indian Oil & Gas industry is quite significant in the global context – it is the third-largest
                energy consumer only behind USA and Chine and contributes to 5.2% of the global oil demand. The complete
                lockdown across the country slowed down the demand of transport fuels (accounting for 2/3rd demand in
                oil & gas sector) as auto & industrial manufacturing declined and goods & passenger movement (both bulk
                & personal) fell. Though the crude prices dipped in this period, the government increased the excise and
                special excise duty to make up for the revenue loss, additionally, road cess was raised too. As a policy
                recommendation, the government may think of passing on the benefits of decreased crude prices to end
                consumers at retail outlets to stimulate demand.

                <br>
                Older persons are particularly susceptible to the risk of infection from COVID-19, especially those with
                chronic health conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
                Older persons are not just struggling with greater health risks but are also likely to be less capable
                of supporting themselves in isolation. Although social distancing is necessary to reduce the spread of
                the disease, if not implemented correctly, such measures can also lead to increased social isolation of
                older persons at a time when they may be at most need of support.

                risks of infection from COVID-19 for persons with disabilities are compounded by other issues, which
                warrant specific action: disruption of services and support, pre-existing health conditions in some
                cases which leave them more at risk of developing serious illness or dying, being excluded from health
                information and mainstream health provision, living in a world where accessibility is often limited and
                where barriers to goods and services are a challenge, and being disproportionately more likely to live
                in institutional settings.

                <br>
                Many governments have called on youth to embrace the effort to protect themselves and the overall
                population. Youth are also in a position to help those who are most vulnerable, and to aid in increasing
                public health social awareness campaigns among their communities. Thus, youth are critical to limiting
                the virus’s spread and its impact on public health, society, and the economy at large.

                More than one billion youth are now no longer physically in school after the closure of schools and
                universities across many jurisdictions. The disruption in education and learning could have medium and
                long-term consequences on the quality of education, though the efforts made by teachers, school
                administrations, local and national governments to cope with the unprecedented circumstances to the best
                of their ability should be recognized.

                physical distancing measures, financial and employment insecurity, housing instability and changes to
                health and social care access. These shifts have profoundly interrupted the systems and structures that
                previously operated to both support the mental health and well-being of families and mitigate the risks
                that contribute to health and social inequities. During the pandemic, many parents have experienced
                increased pressures and erosions to social supports, with implications for their mental health.

                <h3>Indigenous Peoples</h3>
                <br>
                Indigenous peoples are particularly vulnerable at this time due to significantly higher rates of
                communicable and non-communicable diseases, lack of access to essential services, absence of culturally
                appropriate healthcare, and if any, under-equipped and under-staffed local medical facilities.The first
                point of prevention is the dissemination of information in indigenous languages, thus ensuring that
                services and facilities are appropriate to the specific situation of indigenous peoples, and all are
                reached.The large number of indigenous peoples who are outside of the social protection system further
                contributes to vulnerability, particularly if they are dependent on income from the broader economy –
                produce, tourism, handicrafts and employment in urban areas. In this regard, Governments should ensure
                that interim financial support measures include indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups.

                <br>
                In view of the scale of disruption caused by the pandemic, it is evident that the current downturn is
                fundamentally different from recessions. The sudden shrinkage in demand & increased unemployment is
                going to alter the business landscape. Adopting new principles like ‘shift towards localization, cash
                conservation, supply chain resilience and innovation’ will help businesses in treading a new path in
                this uncertain environment.
