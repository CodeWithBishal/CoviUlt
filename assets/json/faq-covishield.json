Preliminary animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryofetal development, parturition or postnatal development; definitive animal studies have not been completed yet. The full relevance of animal studies to human risk with vaccines for COVID-19 remains to be established. Administration of COVISHIELD in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. Recently, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of India said that, 'a pregnant woman who opts for vaccination, could be vaccinated at any time of the pregnancy. To help pregnant women make an informed decision to be vaccinated, they should be provided with information about the risks of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy, the benefits of vaccination, along with the likely side effects of vaccination'.(3) For further details, please refer to <a href='www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/OperationalGuidanceforCOVID19vaccinationofPregnantWoman.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/OperationalGuidanceforCOVID19vaccinationofPregnantWoman.pdf</a>"

            "q": "Can breastfeeding women receive COVISHIELD?",
            "a": "It is unknown whether COVISHIELD is excreted in human milk. However, the current guidelines of the Indian Government state that COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all lactating women. WHO guidelines state that vaccine efficacy is expected to be similar in lactating women as in other adults. Since COVISHIELD (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. On the basis of these considerations, a lactating woman who is part of a group recommended for vaccination according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, e.g. health workers, should be offered vaccination on an equivalent basis. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding after vaccination. It is advisable that breastfeeding mothers should consult their healthcare provider for a risk benefit assessment based on clinical judgement before taking the vaccine."

There is no data available when both these vaccines are used interchangeably. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] products (AstraZeneca AZD1222, SII COVISHIELD) are considered equivalent and interchangeable for both doses and recommends that both doses should be administered with ChAdOx1-S product."

            "a": "Yes, no vaccine is 100% protective. People can get COVID-19 even after vaccination. However, the vaccination will help protect them from developing severe disease. Kindly note that people who get vaccinated should continue to follow all current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19 after they are vaccinated. That means: <ul> <li>Wearing a mask</li> <li>Staying at least six feet away from others</li> <li>Avoiding crowds</li> <li>Washing hands with soap and water or using hand sanitizer</li> </ul>"

            "a": "Very rare events of serious thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, including unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis, some associated with arterial thrombosis, have been observed following vaccination during post-authorization use. The majority of the events occurred within the first 14 days following vaccination whereas the outer limit was 33 days and some events had a fatal outcome. Get medical attention immediately if from a few days following vaccination you get any of the following symptoms: <ol><li> experience a severe or persistent headache, blurred vision, confusion or seizures (fits) </li> <li>develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain or persistent abdominal pain</li> <li> notice unusual skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination </li> </ol> The European Medical Agency (EMA) stated that the overall benefits of the vaccine in the prevention of COVID-19 outweigh risks from adverse events including thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia (TTS)."

            "a": "Data as of now shows that that the vaccine offers protection against the B 1.1.7 (UK) , B.1.167.1 and P.1 (Brazil) variant. The efficacy against the B.1.351 (South Africa) variant was lower. However, it prevented severe disease. As regards the other variants, as of now there is no indication that the vaccine is not working against them."

            "a": "No, COVISHIELD will not cause a positive test result for a COVID-19 RT-PCR or Rapid antigen test. This is because the tests check for active disease and not whether an individual is immune or not."
