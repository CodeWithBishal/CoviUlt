If possible, vaccination could be scheduled prior to the use of these medications, so that the patients’ risk of bleeding is not increased by their therapeutic action. <br> <b>Patients with weak immune system or receiving immunosuppressive medicines:</b><br> Currently there is no data available in individuals with a weakened immune system or who are taking chronic treatment that suppresses or prevents immune responses. People with weakened immune systems due to other illnesses or medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID -19. They may receive COVOVAX™. However, people with weakened immune systems should also be aware of the potential for reduced immune responses to COVOVAX™, as well as the need to continue following all current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19 (see below)."
