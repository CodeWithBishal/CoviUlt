Individuals on simple blood thinners (Aspirin and / or clopidogrel) who have a stable medical disease condition assessed by the vaccination provider may receive intramuscular vaccination. The bleeding may take a little longer to stop in these individuals, and may lead to increased bruising on the upper arm. The immunization of patients with bleeding disorders differs from that of the average population concerning the risk of haematoma formation. A fine needle (23 - 25 gauge) should be used for the vaccination in these individuals, followed by firm pressure applied to the site without rubbing for at least 2 minutes. In case of any doubt, consult with the clinician responsible for prescribing or monitoring the individual’s anticoagulant therapy. Individuals with bleeding disorders may be vaccinated intramuscularly if, in the opinion of a doctor familiar with the individual's bleeding risk the vaccine can be administered with reasonable safety byIntramuscularroute."

Individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions NOT related to vaccines or injectable medications such as environmental allergies, allergies to food, pet dander, venom, or latex- may still get vaccinated. Individuals with a history of allergies to oral medications or a family history of allergic reactions, or who might have a mild allergy to vaccines (but no anaphylaxis) may still get vaccinated."

            "q":"WHAT IF I AM IMMUNOCOMPROMISED?",
            "a":"Individuals with HIV infection or other immunocomprom1smg conditions, or who take immunosuppressive medications or therapies might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. However, data is NOT currently available to establish vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups. Individuals with immunosuppression may not generate a full immune response to COVID-19. Transplant recipients should be counselled that the vaccine's effectiveness and safety profile for them is not currently known. As it is not a live virus vaccine, it is unlikely to pose a safety risk. Transplant recipients may have a weakened immune response compared to the general population. Thus, they should be advised regarding the importance of maintaining all current guidance to protect themselves even after vaccination. Immunocompromised individuals may receive COVID-19 vaccination if they have no contraindications to vaccination."
