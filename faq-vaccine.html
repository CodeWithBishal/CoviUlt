                                are on boarded on Co-WIN platform, become active and start their services.

                                vaccination centers) and by the Site Managers (for private vaccination centers), from
                                time to time. These managers are advised to publish longer schedules to provide
                                sufficient advance visibility of slots to citizens. You should check again for more
                                schedules after some time. (Please also see Q17).

                                provides the next vaccination due. It also is an evidence for the beneficiary to prove

                                any entities which may require proof of vaccination specially in case of travel.

                                Vaccination not only protects individuals from disease, but also reduces their risk of
                                spreading the virus. Therefore, there could be a requirement in future to produce
                                certificate for certain kind of social interactions and international travel.
                                In this context the certificate issued by Co-WIN has built in security features to
                                guarantee genuineness of the certificate which can be digitally verified using approved
                                utilities which are provided in Co-WIN portal. The certificates can be verified by

                                vaccination dates can be submitted. At the time of submission of such request, the
                                documentary proof for the requested correction must also be uploaded. District
                                Immunization Officer of respective districts would examine the matter and would
                                resolve the issue. The status of the request can be tracked by the beneficiary through
