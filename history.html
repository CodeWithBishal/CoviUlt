                        were reported outside China. This time, the EC reached consensus and advised the

                        Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendation and declared the novel
                        coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC. This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since
                        the International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2005. <br>
